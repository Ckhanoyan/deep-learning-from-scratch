Panda vs. Caviar: The Hyperparameter Edition 🐼🍣

Ever feel like you're drowning in hyperparameters and can't decide where to start? Welcome to the world of deep learning!

In the fine art of tuning models, we’ve got two kinds of hyperparameters: panda and caviar.

🐼 Panda Hyperparameters are the basics. Think of them like the bread and butter of your deep learning model. We’re talking the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. They’re the stuff that actually makes or breaks your model’s ability to learn. Adjusting these is like switching from a fast food meal to a decent home-cooked dinner — it’s going to make a noticeable difference right away.

🍣 Caviar Hyperparameters, on the other hand, are the fancy, almost-overkill adjustments. We’re talking dropouts, weight decay, activation functions, or whether your model is using the right type of regularization. Tuning these is like adding caviar to your meal — a fun flex, but it’s not going to change your life unless everything else is already spot on.

So, here’s the secret: Before you start sprinkling that caviar, make sure you’ve got the panda right! Focus on the big-impact stuff first. Once you’ve got your model chugging along with those basic hyperparameters, THEN you can start fine-tuning with the fancy stuff.

Why settle for "meh" results when you can get your model from fast food to 5-star dining? But remember: no matter how fancy your model looks, if the basics aren’t right, your results will still taste like a soggy sandwich.
