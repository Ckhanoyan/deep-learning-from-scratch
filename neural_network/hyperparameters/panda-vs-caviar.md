### Panda 

Panda refers to the more basic, essential hyperparameters that have a substantial impact on the model's performance. In theory, the learning rate and the batch size are the most infuential on the model's ability to learn effectively. The bottom line is that these panda hyperparameters are kind of easy to adjust and provide clear and direct results on your model. 

### Caviar 

Caviar refers to more intricate or sophisticated hyperparameters that have a much smaller effect on the model's performance. It involves others such as activation functions, the number of layers or hidden units, and/or specific regularization techniques. They are usually the details that only provide incremental gains.
