# RMSprop

Yes, it is another technique we may have to consider. It is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm, which means that it adjusts the learning rate during training based on the past gradients, helping to avoid overshooting and speeding up convergence. The key idea is below: 
* If the gradient for a parameter has been consistently large, RMSprop will reduce the learning rate for that specific parameter, preventing it from making huge updates.
* If the gradient has been small, it will increase the learning rate to encourage faster updates.

### Why is RMSprop Important? 

RMSprop will help the model converge faster and more reliably by adjusting the learning rate. It also prevents overshooting by ensuring no large updates when the gradients are large. It handles sparse data, and it works well with datasets where some features are more important than others by adjusting the learning rate accordingly. 

### Ok... But How Is It Useful? 

It can be effective for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or other models that gradients can either explode or vanish.
