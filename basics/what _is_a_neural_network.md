# What is a Neural Network (in plain English)? 

I am asking myself this question too. A neural network is a simple computer system that learns from data just like how we use our human brain (do not worry that my brain takes forever to learn this stuff, and I may have to go through numerous iterations to master my skills!)

Look at it as a collected layers of "neurons" or tiny computing units that pass information to each other and find solutions.

Let's say that you go like, "hey computer, I want to give you a picture of my dog." Or, that you tell your computer to identify whether or not the email you received is spam. From there, your computer or the network has a black box where everything happens as it processes the inputs and understands patterns. Each neuron or computing unit in these hidden layers applies a math operation to decide what information to pass forward. 

For output, you might get "This is not a dog! I do not know what you actually have in your hands right now." Or, you might get this "The email you received is not spam, and congratulations on winning lottery!". 

Wait a minute, how does it learn? Well, take a look at the other files I develop from my learning journey! Enjoy.
