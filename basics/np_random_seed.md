# What is np.random.seed? 

A random seed is a number that initializes a random number generator. While the generated numbers are still pesudo-random, using the same seed ensures that the sequence of random numbers is reproducible.

Without a seed, the random numbers would be different each time you run the code. In the other words, you can generate the same "random" results for any reasons. 

What happens without using a seed? The random numbers will differ.
