# What is a logistic regression?

Logistic regression is a statistical model that predicts probabilities. It is commonly used for binary classification problems, where the output is either 0 or 1. 

We compute the weighted sum of inputs and a bias like this below:
z = w.T * X + b

Then we apply the sigmoid function to z:
A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
