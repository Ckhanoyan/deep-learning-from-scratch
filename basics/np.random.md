# Key Components for np.random.randn

This is a NumPy function that generates samples from the standard normal distribution. Remember, a standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Suppose that you have a np.random.randn(1, 3), and (1, 3) represents one row and three columns. it will produce something like this below:

array([[0.2343, -0.2234, 0.3455]])

### Why is it important? 
We have to use it often in scenarios like initializing weights in machine learning models, simulating random data for experiments, and testing algorithms with random inputs.

### What is a standard normal distribution and standard deviation?
The standard normal distrbiution is a specific type of bell-shaped curve that shows how data is distributed. Mean(average) is 0, which means the center of the curve is at 0. 

Meanwhile, a standard deviation just tells us how far, on average, the data points are from the mean, e.g., if the standard deviation is small, then the data is tightly packed around the mean. If it is large, then the data is more spread out. 

This is the bell curve shape below for example. Most data within 1 standard deviation of the mean (68% of the total). In the other words, 1 standard deviation (blue shaded area) shows 68% of the data lies between -1 and 1.
