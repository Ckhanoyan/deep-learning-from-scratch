# My Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my deep learning journey! This repository documents my process of learning and applying machine learning and deep learning techniques from scratch. It is a hands-on exploration of foundational concepts and their practical implementations.

## What's Inside?

This repository has grown to include a comprehensive range of topics and projects. Here's what you'll find:

- **Foundational Machine Learning Concepts**:  
  Starting with basics like logistic regression, gradient descent, and optimization techniques, setting the stage for deeper topics.

- **Step-by-Step Deep Learning Implementations**:  
  Explore how theoretical concepts translate into code as I build algorithms like neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) from scratch.

- **Sequence Models and RNN Architectures**:  
  Learn about various RNN types (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many) and their use cases, such as music generation, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

- **Practical Projects**:  
  Hands-on projects and experiments in Jupyter Notebooks, applying learned concepts to real-world problems.

- **Resources for Learners**:  
  Additional notes, visualizations, and documentation to support deeper understanding.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

As I continue this journey, my focus will be on:

- Exploring advanced deep learning topics such as attention mechanisms, transformers, and generative models.
- Applying these techniques to practical use cases like natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and time-series forecasting.
- Sharing more detailed write-ups and tutorials to help others learn alongside me.
