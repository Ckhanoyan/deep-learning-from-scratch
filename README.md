# My Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my deep learning journey! This repository is where I document my process of learning and applying machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## What You'll Find Here:
- **Basic Machine Learning Concepts**: Starting with logistic regression, forward and backward propagation, and optimization.
- **Step-by-Step Code Walkthroughs**: Learn how the theory translates into code as I implement algorithms from scratch.
- **Future Deep Learning Models**: I plan to expand to more advanced models like neural networks, CNNs, and RNNs.

## My Journey So Far:
I began by understanding the basics of **logistic regression**, which is the foundation of many machine learning algorithms. Through this, I learned about the concepts of **forward propagation** (how data moves through the model) and **backward propagation** (how the model learns by adjusting weights). These concepts are the building blocks for more complex models.

## Folder Structure

Here's how this repository is organized:

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks documenting my experiments and learnings.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts used for deep learning tasks.
- **data/**: Placeholder for datasets or links to external datasets.
- **images/**: Visualizations, graphs, or screenshots related to my progress.
- **docs/**: Additional notes or resources for deeper understanding.

## What's Next?
As I continue this learning process, I plan to dive deeper into advanced deep learning topics like neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). I will update this repository with my progress and new learnings.

Thank you for following along on my deep learning journey!
