# Semenatic Segmentation and U-Net 

Semantic segmentation is another computer vision task that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a predefined class or label. It helps classify meaningful regions where each pixel belongs to a specific category, e.g., person, car, traffic lights, etc. U-net is one of the most important architectures designed for semantic segmentation tasks that works very effectively, and it has been used in many various fields from medical image work to something else.
