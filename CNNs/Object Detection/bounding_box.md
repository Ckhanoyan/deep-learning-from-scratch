# What is the Bounding Box? 

The bounding box helps detect an object in an image using the red box, e.g., locating and defining the position of an object in an image. It is represented by 4 values such as below: 

* bx = the x-coorindate of the center of the bounding box
* by = the y-coorindate of the center of the bounding box
* bh = the height of the bounding box
* bw = the width of the bounding box

### Real World Use Case

We can build an object detection to detect cars in an image, such as a self-driving car's camera system. When it detects a car in an image, it will draw a red bounding box around it.
